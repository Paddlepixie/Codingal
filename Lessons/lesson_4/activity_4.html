        <p>St. Michaelâ€™s High School, located at Digha Ghat in Patna, is a Catholic Missionary educational instition, founded in 1858, by the first Bishop of Patna, Dr. Anastasius Hartmann (of the Franciscan (Capuchin) Missionary Society). Begun as a boarding school for poor and orphan boys under the Catholic Chruch at Kurji, the School has witnessed tremendous growth in terms of strength of students on its rolls, and physical infrastructure. With over 3000 students (both boys and girls) on its rolls today, the school is poised for further growth as it moves into the 165th year of its founding.
